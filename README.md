**# CS-305-Software-Security**

**1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

Artemis Financial is a consulting company focusing on clients' financial plans such as savings, retirement, etc. The client wants to address how to modernize their operations using the most current and adequate software security.

**2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

I did very well in analyzing a strategic mitigation plan to help the client move forward. It is essential to code securely because it can help protect the client's business data from leaking into the public domain. Software security helps the company's well-being by preventing unauthorized users from obtaining sensitive data. By doing so, more customers will feel safe and trust the organization, allowing the company to continue to grow.

**3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

A helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was analyzing the manual review of the vulnerabilities. By thoroughly reviewing the vulnerability report, the vulnerability assessment also gives me an understanding of how to identify, research, and remediate security vulnerabilities that can apply to the real world.

**4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

Ways to increase lays are using a RestController that includes a checksum method, updating dependency checks to the most updated version, and having Self-signed certificates. To assess vulnerabilities, I would use a vulnerability scanner to scan known vulnerabilities and use secure coding practices such as following OWASP secure coding guidelines, code reviews, and ensuring the software is up to date.

**5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

I ensured the code and software application were functional and secure by re-running the dependency checks and using static and dynamic testing on the code. Using static and dynamic testing, the code becomes reliable while maintaining code quality.

**6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

The maven dependency tool and understanding false positive vulnerabilities would be helpful in future assignments or tasks. Maven is useful because it helps to simplify the process of dependency management. I can accurately determine if a vulnerability exists by understanding false positives within the vulnerability assessment.

**7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

An exmaple of work I would show to futuer employeers is the functionality testing to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. The code will allow future employers that I am capable of using standard industry practices.
